# MarsX WIP


This mod was last updated in 2017, I have spent my time since then developing a lot of it's primary features as standalone mods for Rimworld to maximise their usefulness. At the same time I have been working on a very big update for MarsX using stuff I developed for those standalone mods, plus lots of prototypes for new features.

The project became very large and difficult to work on, so to help my workflow and provide something that's playable, i have updated the original A16 version of the mod to work for Rimworld 1.1, which will be maintained as a stable working version of the mod while i gradually replace every part of it piece by piece with code from the big project, so that i can make sure each feature is finished properly.

Some bits will be easy to swap out quickly, others might take a while, i'll chat about what im working on next on my discord here https://discord.gg/Y4tZbUd
